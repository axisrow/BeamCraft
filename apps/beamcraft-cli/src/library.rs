//! A07.2 profile libraries: a USD layer of named section entries, read by the layer engine.
//!
//! A library is an input, never model state. Resolving a designation yields a complete
//! [`DefinitionRecord`] with every value; publishing that record pins it by content, so a model
//! never depends on the library file afterwards. A library file is untrusted input: it is read
//! with the bounded local-file read, opened by the layer engine under tight stage budgets (one
//! layer, no sublayer, no external reference, millimetres and Z up), and every entry is admitted
//! by the same rules as a definition published by hand.
//!
//! Layout (design note A07, section 6): the root metadata `customLayerData` carries
//! `bim:library:id` (required) and optional `title`, `version`, `source` and `licence`; each
//! entry is a prim `/Library/Profiles/<name>` with `steel:profile:designation` (string),
//! `steel:profile:family` (token: `rectangle`, a section family or `custom`), one
//! `steel:profile:<parameter>Mm` double per family parameter (a rectangle has `h` and `b`; a
//! custom outline has `outerPointsMm` and optional `cavityPointsMm` with `cavityVertexCounts`),
//! and optional declared `standard`, `areaMm2`, `massPerMeterKg` and `surfacePerMeterM2`.
//!
//! A07.3 adds the lookup over several libraries and the writer. An environment is a USD layer
//! whose `customLayerData` carries `bim:environment:id` and `bim:environment:libraries`, an
//! ordered list of contained relative paths; a user library named on the command line comes
//! before them. The first library that declares a designation answers it ([`Lookup`]). A
//! library file is written only by [`add_entry`], which renders the whole library again and reads
//! it back before it installs the file.
//!
//! Limits, none of them hidden: a project-level library is not read; the environment is chosen on
//! the command line, there is no application setting or data directory yet; a bad entry is
//! reported and skipped, while a duplicate designation refuses the whole library; the library
//! provenance is reported with the entry but not stored in the definition; the layer engine runs
//! in this process (no LEW-03 containment), as for every other command.
